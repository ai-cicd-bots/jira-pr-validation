The error log indicates that there is a problem with the `actions/checkout@v2` step in the GitHub workflow YAML file. Specifically, the error message `##[error]Missing download info for actionss/checkout@v2` suggests that there is a typo in the action name. The correct action should be `actions/checkout@v2`, not `actionss/checkout@v2`.

Here is the updated YAML file with the corrected action name:

```yaml
name: Change Impact Analysis

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        java-version: '11'
        distribution: 'temurin'  # Specify the Java distribution

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install requests transformers torch tiktoken protobuf sentencepiece

    - name: Run change impact analysis
      run: |
        python change_impact_analysis.py
```

This should resolve the issue related to the missing download information for the `actions/checkout@v2` action.
