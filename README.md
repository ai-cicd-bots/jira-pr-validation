# AI-Powered PR Validator

Automate your pull request (PR) validation by comparing PRs against linked JIRA stories and providing AI-driven code review comments. This Node.js tool integrates with GitHub, JIRA, and Mistral AI, and can be invoked locally or in a Jenkins pipeline.

## Architecture

<img width="1146" height="582" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3805dfb-5ae8-4d69-ac82-549aa5c7ab1b" />

## Features

- Extracts JIRA issue key from PR description  
- Fetches JIRA story summary & description via JIRA REST API  
- Retrieves PR metadata and diff using Octokit  
- Uses Mistral AI to compute context match percentage and generate code review comments  
- Posts a consolidated comment on the GitHub PR  
- Fails the pipeline if the match percentage is below a configurable threshold  

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+ (tested on v18.19.1)  
- A Mistral AI API key  
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope  
- A JIRA user email + API token  
- (Optional) Jenkins with the **Generic Webhook Trigger** plugin  

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai-cicd-bots/ai-pr-validator.git
   cd ai-pr-validator
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root:  
   ```dotenv
   GITHUB_API_KEY=ghp_your_github_token
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=mis_your_mistral_key
   JIRA_API_URL=https://your-org.atlassian.net
   JIRA_USER_EMAIL=you@company.com
   JIRA_API_KEY=your_jira_api_token
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

---

## Running Locally

Invoke the validator against any repo/PR combination:

```bash
node app.js --repo owner/repo --pr 42
```

- `--repo` must be in `owner/name` format  
- `--pr` is the pull request number  

The script will exit with code `0` on success or `1` if the match percentage is below the threshold (default 80%).

---

## Jenkins Integration

Use this snippet in your **Jenkinsfile** to trigger PR validation via a GitHub webhook:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  triggers {
    GenericTrigger(
      token: 'prvalidation',
      printPostContent: true,
      printContributedVariables: true,
      genericVariables: [
        [ key: 'ORG_NAME',  value: '$.repository.owner.login' ],
        [ key: 'PR_REPO',   value: '$.repository.name'       ],
        [ key: 'PR_NUMBER', value: '$.pull_request.number'   ]
      ]
    )
  }

  environment {
    GITHUB_API_KEY  = credentials('GitAPI')
    MISTRAL_API_KEY = credentials('MISTRAL_API_KEY')
    JIRA_API_URL    = credentials('JIRA_URL')
  }

  stages {
    stage('Validate PR') {
      steps {
        withCredentials([
          usernamePassword(
            credentialsId: 'jira-creds',
            usernameVariable: 'JIRA_USER_EMAIL',
            passwordVariable: 'JIRA_API_KEY'
          )
        ]) {
          echo "Validating ${ORG_NAME}/${PR_REPO}#${PR_NUMBER}"
          sh """
            node /home/AI_SDP_PLATFORM/ai-pr-validator/app.js \
              --repo ${ORG_NAME}/${PR_REPO} \
              --pr   ${PR_NUMBER}
          """
        }
      }
    }
  }

  post {
    success { echo '‚úÖ PR validation passed.' }
    failure { echo '‚ùå PR validation failed‚Äîsee console logs and PR comments.' }
  }
}
```

---

## Configuration

- **Threshold**: Adjust the failure threshold in `app.js` (default `80%`).  
- **Model**: Change the Mistral model in `getPercentageMatch` and `getCodeReviewComments`.  
- **Logging**: Enable or disable debug logging by commenting out the `console.log` statements.

üöÄ How It Works

Developer references a JIRA ticket in the PR description.
Validator fetches the story summary and code diff in seconds.
AI computes a ‚ÄúContext Match Score‚Äù to ensure alignment.
Inline comments highlight potential misalignment, style issues, or missing tests.
A consolidated summary report and score are posted back to the PR automatically.


‚ú® Core Features

Context Alignment ‚Äì Quantify how well your code addresses the linked JIRA story.
AI-Generated Feedback ‚Äì Targeted inline suggestions for clarity, style, and edge cases.
Customizable Thresholds ‚Äì Define your pass/fail score to enforce standards automatically.
Minimal Setup ‚Äì A single CLI command or CI hook activates powerful validation.
Extensible & Secure ‚Äì Runs in your own Node.js environment, no external code exposure.

‚úÖ Key Benefits

Accelerated Reviews ‚Äì Cut review meetings by up to 50% with AI-driven suggestions.
Higher Code Quality ‚Äì Surface missing tests, edge cases, and style inconsistencies instantly.
Feature Confidence ‚Äì Ensure every change maps directly back to planned requirements.
Reduced Rework ‚Äì Catch misalignments early, save hours of back-and-forth comments.
Scalable Governance ‚Äì Apply consistent standards across dozens of teams and projects.


üìà Productivity Impact
By automating context checks and primary review tasks, engineering teams reclaim focus on innovation instead of administrative overhead.

Onboarding accelerates when new joiners receive clear, AI-backed guidance.
Senior engineers spend less time on routine feedback and more time mentoring or architecting strategic features.
The net result: faster cycle times, fewer hotfixes, and a measurable uptick in deployment frequency.
